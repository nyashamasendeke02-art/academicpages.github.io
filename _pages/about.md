What is machine learning
------
The Machine Learning is the use of different techniques and methods for computers to learn and adapt using data.


What are the fields related to machine learning
------
Neuroscince.\
Physics.\
Computer Science.\
Mathematics\
Statistics \
etc.

What are the different paradigms of machine learning
------
Supervised learning\
Unsupervsed learning\
Semi Supervised Learning.\
Reinforcement Learning.



What are the different tribes of machine learning
------
Bayesian learning\
Evolutionaries\
Analogizers\
Symbolists\
Connectionists
etc.

What is the bigger picture
------
Machine learning is trying to create smart systems that in learn from data.
The creation of these systems has different approaches all of which are trying to archieve the same goal.
On the one side engineers and scientists believe mimicking the brain functionality is the way to create intelligent systems.
On the other side there are those who believe that intelligent sytems do not necessarily have to mimick the overall functionlaity of the brain.
Just a bird can fly and an aeroplane can fly but an aeroplane cant bird.
